# Algos-And-Data-Structures

## Introduction
Welcome to my Algorithms and Data Structures Repository! A comprehensive collection of various algorithms and data structures implemented in python. This repository serves as a resource for learning and refining algorithmic problem-solving skills, covering everything from basic to advanced structures and algorithm concepts. ðŸ§ ðŸ§©

## Coursework Overview

In this repository, you'll find a wide array of problems solved and data structures implemented, including but not limited to:

- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**
    - Quick Sort Algorithm: A divide and conquer algorithm that sorts by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the array around it.
    - Binary Search: An efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items, using a divide and conquer approach.
    - Brute-force Pattern Matching: A straightforward approach to finding a substring within a string.
    - KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Pattern Matching: An algorithm that improves the efficiency of substring search.
    - Boyer-Moore Pattern Matching: A highly efficient string searching algorithm, particularly for large alphabets.

- **Tree and Graph Algorithms**
    - Binary Search Tree Implementation: A node-based tree data structure that maintains sorted data in a way that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.
    - Tree Traversal Techniques: Various methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order) for traversing or searching a tree structure.

- **Data Structures**
    - Linked Lists: Implementations of singly and doubly linked lists.
    - Trees and Graphs: Basic tree structures and graph algorithms.
    - Stacks: Implementation using arrays and linked lists, supporting basic operations like push, pop, and top.
    - Queues: Implementation using circular arrays, supporting enqueue and dequeue operations.
    - Hash Maps: Implementations using chaining and open addressing for collision resolution.

- **Classic Problems and Implementations**
    - The "Three Missionaries and Three Cannibals" puzzle.

- **Map Implementations**
    - Unsorted Table Map: A map implemented using an unsorted list.
    - Chain Hash Map: A hash map implementation using separate chaining for collision resolution.
