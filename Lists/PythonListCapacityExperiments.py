"""
R-5.1 Execute the experiment from Code Fragment 5.1 and compare the results
on your system to those we report in Code Fragment 5.2.

R-5.2 In Code Fragment 5.1, we perform an experiment to compare the length of
a Python list to its underlying memory usage. Determining the sequence
of array sizes requires a manual inspection of the output of that program.
Redesign the experiment so that the program outputs only those values of
k at which the existing capacity is exhausted. For example, on a system
consistent with the results of Code Fragment 5.2, your program should
output that the sequence of array capacities are 0, 4, 8, 16, 25, . . . .

R-5.3 Modify the experiment from Code Fragment 5.1 in order to demonstrate
that Pythonâ€™s list class occasionally shrinks the size of its underlying array
when elements are popped from a list.
